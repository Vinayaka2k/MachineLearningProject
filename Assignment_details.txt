DETAILS ON PROJECT
------------------------------------------------------------------

1. The project will be evaluated for 40 marks and reduced to 20.
2. Students will execute the project in groups of 3 (no less, no more unless inevitable)
3. Each section (A,B,C etc) will execute 1 project.
4. The shared folder has details on datasets, attributes and problem_statements.
   Section-wise folders have been created. Students from respective sections will
   work on the problem statement according to their folder.
   
5. The evaluation of the project wil be conducted on Nov 27th and Nov 29th.
    (If it spills over, Nov 30th will also be utilized)
	
6. Break up of marks is as follows.
    a) Presentation: 10 marks
	b) Demo: 15 marks
	c) Report: 5 marks
	d) Viva: 10 marks
	
12. Out of 20 marks for project, 3 marks are allocated for "outstanding" work.
    The criterion for “outstanding” work is: The Implementation must have a clear
	mathematical basis. Report and demo must constitute clear parsing of
	algorithm through data. If this is not done, the project will be evaluated out of
	17 marks only. This does not mean students are guaranteed to get 17 marks. It
	only means that their max marks will be 17.
	
13. Coding for the main algorithm MUST be done from scratch. 
    Students can use third-party tools for visualization and other cosmetic work.
	
14. Code-plagirism will be dealt with severely.
    Details are as follows:
	
	Upto 20% Plagirism: No penalty
	Between 20% and 40%: 10 marks will be deducted (out of 20)
	Above 40%: 0 marks will be awarded (project must be re-done)
	
15. Deliverables:

    a. Code
	b. Project report. (not exceeding 10 pages)
	c. Presentation (PPT)
